<b>The Company:</b><br>
To see a manufacturing company shaping the future of our world, look no further than MacDon, a world leader in the production of agricultural and harvesting equipment. For over 70 years, MacDon has supported farmers in the cultivation of crops necessary to feed, clothe, and support the global community. As consumer needs grow, MacDon has adapted with impressive flexibility — but they eventually hit a wall with their legacy technology.<br><br>
<b>The Struggle:</b><br>
MacDon offered a self-service dealer portal utilizing legacy Liferay software. While the platform was once robust enough to address the manufacturing company’s needs, new supply chain challenges and mounting customer expectations led MacDon to recognize significant pain points.<br><br>
For example, MacDon’s high standards for user experience weren’t being met with their existing technology. The look and feel of the site were noticeably outdated, while mobile users routinely encountered issues when accessing the platform. Further, the impressive amount of data created by the company wasn’t being managed in an efficient manner, leaving platform users to waste time and effort on document management tasks.<br><br>
<b>The Solution:</b><br>
MacDon knew it was time to begin their digital transformation journey. However, their legacy system required careful navigation and adaptation — a frequent need in the manufacturing space.<br><br>
With help from a Liferay partner, MacDon was able to upgrade their platform without having to start from scratch. By migrating big data from legacy systems and taking advantage of the existing framework, this digital transformation journey addressed significant challenges while creating new functionality for users.<br><br>
On the upgraded MacDon dealer portal, users can retrieve invoice information, check production inventory, create shopping lists, submit warranty claims, and perform key self-service tasks. Equally as important, the manufacturer’s big data is now much easier to navigate and control, enabling the efficient completion of document management operations.<br><br>
<b>The Results:</b><br>
The new MacDon portal is a true testament to the power of digital transformation. It’s not just sleek, modern, and easy to use; it also delivers significant results:<br>
- Overall sales increased by 20%.<br>
- eCommerce transactions have increased by 50%.<br>
- Site visitor numbers have doubled.<br>
- Call, fax, and in-person orders have decreased thanks to easier self-service and online options.
