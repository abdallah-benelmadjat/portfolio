Olympus is passionate about creating customer-driven solutions for the medical, life sciences, and industrial equipment industries. For over 100 years, Olympus has focused on making people’s lives healthier, safer, and more fulfilling. Their vision is to help detect, prevent, and treat diseases and advance scientific research while ensuring public safety. Olympus is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, with more than 35,000 employees worldwide in nearly 40 countries and regions.<br><br>
<b>Challenges faced:</b><br>
- Modernization: Olympus struggled to modernize its operations as the tool it used could not support this vision.<br>
- Burden on IT: Every small change in their operations required a team of skilled IT professionals to implement.<br>
- Integration: A simple integration, such as linking their database to spreadsheets, was a challenge using their old workflow automation tool.<br><br>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
Olympus ES transitioned many of its processes from its old tool to Kissflow, including purchasing processes, RMAs, demo requests, and offering discounts. The ability to add attachments, reassign tasks midstream, and modify data were big selling points.<br><br>
<b>Results:</b><br>
- Reduced process cycle time<br>
